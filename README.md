Algorithmic-Problem-Solving
===========================

Solutions and code I wrote while solving problems in online judges. They're categorized according to major algorithms used even though a particular solution may contain usage of multiple classes of algorithms. Most of the problems can be found at the online judge LightOJ (www.lightoj.com).
